plan dzialania po pobraniu tiled osm
	turn to geojson
	add data from your own files (write a script that will assign all buildings to addresses)
	split to layers



java program to download tiles
tree clusters
get the geojson tiles through API and then show them when needed
download the geojson data from OSMB and prvide it locally (modify script)

is there a way to flatten a projection? (like 45 deg)
